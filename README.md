# Plutonium Portable
Simple Batch Script to create a portable [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw) Installation

Usage:<br>
Download the portable-launcher.bat and put it wherever you want your Plutonium Portable Installation to be and run it, select which downloader to use and let it download all nessesary files and wait till it starts Plutonium.<br>
To update or launch Plutonium just run the portable-launcher.bat again.

I also added portable-lan-launcher.bat which allows to launch Games offline in lan mode without entering the Plutonium Launcher at all.<br>
Mostly made that for myself if they ever implement the License Check but figured i might aswell upload it here for others.<br>
Just put it in the same folder as the portable-launcher and run it, everything there should be self explanatory.
