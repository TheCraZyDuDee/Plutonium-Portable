# Plutonium Portable
## I just realized that the official plutonium.exe aswell supports portable installations by using -install-dir (directory) as start option so i might change to that or provide 2 seperate scripts
Simple Batch Script to create a portable [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw/) Installation

Usage:<br>
Download the portable-launcher.bat and put it wherever you want your Plutonium Portable Installation to be and run it, let it download all nessesary files and wait till it starts Plutonium.<br>
To update or launch Plutonium just run the portable-launcher.bat again.
